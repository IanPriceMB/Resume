    info: `Hey, hey, hey, and welcome! I'm glad you found your way to my little corner of the internet.\n
I'm Ian Price. A man of many hats. Software engineer, novelist, gamer, and much more.\n
Born and raised in Louisville, Colorado. I've found my home in Plano, Texas.\n 
After finishing my schooling at the University of Denver, where I pursued a degree in Business Management with a minor in vocal studies, I committed to a career as a competitive gamer. Over the course of my tenure, I learned a lot about leadership, the value of teamwork, and the growth mindset. During those years and for a time after, I also contributed to content creation for clients and began to dabble in writing.\n
When the Heroes of the Storm Global Championships shut down, I didn't rest on my laurels. Instead, I chose to pursue Web Development through a course at the University of Denver. Several Storied years later, I climbed the ladder to Lead Engineer before opening my own software consulting and development business.\n
While working for clients in these past years, not only have I gotten a chance to compete again, but I have also grown my portfolio and skills as a Software Engineer and novelist. In both creative endeavors, I leverage my skills as a Prompt Engineer with Chat GPT and Open AI solutions.\n
I've been a member of the DFW Writers Workshop for two years and started my own video game development journey with Box-kun, a rouge-lite rail shooter. I'm currently spearheading the project, deepening my knowledge of JIRA while simultaneously exploring writing for games and the Unreal Engine.\n 
I hope you find me interesting.\n

-Ian `,
